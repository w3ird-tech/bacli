# Bitaxe CLI

Bitaxe CLI, or bacli, is a wrapper around the Bitaxe API, enabling the management of a Bitaxe
device in an easy to use way.

## Quickstart

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/w3ird-tech/bacli/releases).

## Development

Bacli is built on stable Rust. Ensure Rust is installed; the easiest way to do so is using
[`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).

To build, use cargo in release mode from the root of the project.

```shell
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/bacli`.
